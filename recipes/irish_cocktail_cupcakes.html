        <li>9 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking s1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whitoda</li>
        <li>1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Irish cream liqueur (such as Baileys®), or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Irish whiskey (such as Jameson®), or to taste</li>
        <li>2 3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Combine stout beer and butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Heat until butter melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in brown sugar and cocoa.</li>
        <li>Whisk sour cream, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl; pour into the saucepan and mix until a smooth batter forms.</li>
        <li>Stir flour and baking soda together. Fold into the batter. Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Leave in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Make frosting while the cupcakes cool. Place butter in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in Irish cream and whiskey on low speed. Gradually spoon in confectioners' sugar, mixing on low speed until frosting is smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Spread frosting over cupcakes. </li>
        </ol>
